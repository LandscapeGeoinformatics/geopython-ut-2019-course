Lesson 5 overview
=================

During this lesson we will learn a few really useful and commonly used GIS functionalities using Geopandas and PySAL.

1. :doc:`Data classification and re-classification <reclassify>`
2. :doc:`Exercise 3 <exercise>`
3. :doc:`Exercise 3 hints <exercise-hints>`

Learning goals
--------------

After this lesson's lesson you should be able to:

 - learn about different classification schemes
 - reclassify data based on different criteria (custom or common classifiers).
 - merge data, i.e. join spatial and non-spatial datasets together, based on some common identifier.
