Exercise 4
==========

This lesson we will practice how to create static and interactive maps in Python.

- Don't forget to check out the `hints for this lesson's exercise <exercise-hints.html>`_.

- Scores on this exercise are out of **10 points**.

Read a few useful additional hints about what to consider when creating maps `from this post <https://www.gislounge.com/ten-things-to-consider-when-making-a-map>`_.

Consider looking for some interesting datasets from various providers:

- the `Estonian Geoportal <https://geoportaal.maaamet.ee/>`_
- the Estonian Statistics Board data portal: `Statistics Estonia <https://estat.stat.ee/StatistikaKaart/VKR>`_
- the Estonian registry for environmental data: `Keskkonnaregister <http://register.keskkonnainfo.ee/envreg/>`_
- `Estonian Open Data Portal <https://opendata.riik.ee/>`_
- `datasets from Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets>`_
- the `GEOSS Geoportal <https://www.geoportal.org/>`_

Consider the design - classifications, colors and colormaps, resolution, legend) ...
and the story - which datasets/layers together make an interesting map to present.

**Use your imagination**, do some additional calculations and apply the analysis methods you have learned during the course
to new datasets that you find online (or from your other work/study projects).

But notice that the main aim here is that you try to do the visualizations as best as you can, it needs to look good and should make sense.

Submit your maps (png, html) and source code (.ipynb)` to Moodle and make sure to provide the download links for the data used!


Problem 1: Visualize a static map with multiple layers on it (5 points)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find interesting datasets and mix them in order and **create an interesting, good and beautiful STATIC map**.


Problem 2: Visualize an interactive map (5 points)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may reuse the datasets from the static maps exercise from Problem 1 above.
This time **create as interesting, good and beautiful INTERACTIVE map**.
Use **either** Bokeh **or** Folium.
